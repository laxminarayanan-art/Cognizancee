## **MOTIVATION:**

> :octocat:  "My favourite course was CAD"  :octocat:

* In my first semester, I had a course called MEE and I learnt CAD under this course.I used AUTOCAD software to draw designs.That turned out to be my favourite course in that semester.
* So, as soon as I heard about the task the concept of making a landing page for CAD course came into my mind and that stood as a main motivation to create a landing page for CAD course.
