## **THEME:**
     :white_check_mark: The theme of this landing page is to advertise a free :free: online CAD course among the people.
<hr>

## **MOTIVATION:**

  :octocat: === "My favourite course was CAD" === :octocat:
     In my first semester, I had a course called MEE and I learnt CAD under this course.I used AUTOCAD software to draw designs.That turned out to be my favourite course in that semester.
     So, as soon as I heard about the task the concept of making a landing page for CAD course came into my mind and that stood as a main motivation to create a landing page for CAD course.
<hr>

## **FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:** 
     The landing page that I created was for CAD basics.As CAD is a important course and an interesting course I want to provide more topic video for students.As this is a free online course many students can make use of this and learn this course which will be very useful for them in future.

    As soon as more course videos are uploaded
    steps will be taken by our group to create a software with the students who have actively participated in quizzes and contest conducted by our team.
